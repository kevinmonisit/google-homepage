# google-homepage
Practicing flexbox by making the google homepage.

Live preview: https://kevinmonisit.github.io/google-homepage/

Known bugs: 
- the 'carbon neutral since 2007' has position: absolute and when the window height shrinks, the statement leaves the footer. Will look into it whenever possible.
- the footer background-color is offset when window width is small and justify-align:column is set in media query (most likely padding issue)
